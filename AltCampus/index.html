<dt class = "dt"><li>Tell us Your story</li></dt>
<dd class = "dd">I am currently working as a ServiceNow System administrator and developer. Like everyone, I too joined the IT industry with lots of hopes of becoming a good programmer, but I didn't receive enough support from my organization who made me work in manual testing and other non-productive works for the first 18 months. I have learned so many technologies in the past 2 years but haven't given a chance to prove my skills. And at one point I realized that learning alone won't help me to fulfill my dreams of becoming a good developer and decided to take a break from my career and improve my programming skills. All I need currently is a good mentor who can help me in fulfilling my dreams of becoming a blockchain developer.</dd><br>
<dt class = "dt"><li>Why do you want to learn web developement?</li></dt>
<dd class = "dd">Web development comes with a load of transferable skills which will be very helpful for me to get into other areas in the IT Industry. When I wanted to get into Blockchain development the first criterion was a good hands-on experience in Node JS. This was a blocker to me in fulfilling my dream of becoming a blockchain developer. So I feel that a solid hands-on experience in Web development will prepare me for challenging roles in other technologies as well.</dd><br>
<dt class = "dt"><li>Tell us a little bit about the person who has had the most impact on you and how ?</li></dt>
<dd class = "dd">It's one of my colleagues from the Customer side. Like me, he too spent the first 3 years of his career in a non-technical work. Then he decided to make a bold decision of leaving his job and working on his technical skills. Up to my knowledge, I haven't seen any better programmer than him. He is one of the talented people I have ever met and inspirational figure to me.</dd><br>
<dt class = "dt"><li>What's your preferred learning style? How do you think you learn something best?</li></dt>
<dd class = "dd">My preferred learning style is always in online courses only. But I was not getting any better by doing those courses. I would prefer to co-learn with like-minded people and build some cool projects which will help me and my co-learners. Contributing to open-source projects is always my dream But I am not really ready to do so now. I believe this program and some hands-on experience will help me in getting better. 	</dd><br>
<dt class = "dt"><li>What's the hardest thing you have done so far?</li></dt>
<dd class = "dd">The hardest decision I have ever taken is leaving a good paying job and decided to work on upgrading myself. I believe that this decision is one of the best decisions I have ever made in my life and will make my future better.</dd><br>
<dt class = "dt"><li>What do you think are your best qualities?</li></dt>
<dd class = "dd">My willingness to constantly upgrade my skill sets will be considered as my best quality. Apart from that hardworking nature and helping others are my best qualities.</dd><br>
<dt class = "dt"><li>Why do you want to join altcampus?</li></dt>
<dd class = "dd">I was looking for an affordable programming bootcamp and a community where I can learn and contribute to others. While searching online I came to know about altcampus and the curriculum was exactly matching what I was looking for. And it is located in the mighty himalayas.</dd><br>
